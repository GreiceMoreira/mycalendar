# Overview

This project is a mobile application built with React Native that allows users to create and manage tasks directly in a calendar. Each task can be assigned a type, and tasks are displayed on the calendar so the user can easily see what kind of events are scheduled for each day.

The main goal of this project is to practice building a mobile frontend and connecting it to a backend API (developed in Java). The app aims to improve task organization by providing a simple and interactive calendar interface.
